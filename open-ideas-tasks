Ideas that could be implemented:

- Enable displaying weather boxes for daily weather for the next X days.
  Could/would integrate into weather-boxes component.
- add translations for other languages (app uses i18n strings in english only
  currently)
- could make weather boxes swipeable instead of a long list. perhaps use
  swiper.js
- create e2e tests for simple tasks (prefer webdriverio, but anything acceptable)
- refetch the city every X minutes (e.g. 30?)
- create popup which asks to "download the app" (probably combine it with
  cookies to store the decision of the user to not annoy anyone. and display
after some minutes and not instantly)
- rate limit the api calls when user is not using his own openapi key (I guess
  this should be combined with a flag in .env file if we want to rate limit)
