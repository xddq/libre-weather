Ideas that could be implemented:

- remembering the last searched loocation via cookies. (check if this requires
  cookies to be adapted or if this counts as functional, when implementing this
task.)
- add pop/probability of precipation to the chart (hourly and daily) I would say
  at the bottom. I did this already with drawing umbrellas and the percentage
but somehow lost it and could not find the commit again.
- make weather boxes (the hourly and in future daily ones) swipeable instead of
  just displaying all of them. (I would prefer self coded, but could just use
swiper.js library.)
- enable toggling between metric and usa units. (first step in client, second
  step store the seconds in cookie?)
- integrate daily weather boxes into the weather boxes component
- create e2e tests for simple tasks (I would prefer cypress or puppeteer)
- refetch the city every X minutes (e.g. 30?)
- create popup which asks to "download the app" (probably combine it with
  cookies to store the decision of the user to not annoy anyone. and display
after some minutes and not instantly)
- add translations for other languages (app uses i18n strings in english only
  currently)
- rate limit the api calls when user is not using his own openapi key (I guess
  this should be combined with a flag in .env file if we want to rate limit)
- set up cicd for this (I would prefer to use gitlab ci, since this is where I
  host most of my stuff, and will PROBABLY do this task myself)


Not reallly related, but what I should do one day:
- figure out how to include a donations page with different cryptos (this is not
  app specific but I want to do this for other pages anyway and it has to be
done once.)
- read about matomo and possibly add it while keeping users privacy just to get
  some infos about the usage of the service. (probably again with flag in .env)
