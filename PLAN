TODOS:
- try merge requests workflow although I am working alone until first release.
  See how it will play out. --> Use feature branch workflock for all other
todos. - DONE
- add .env.example (did lose my .env since I switched workstation) - DONE
- adapt ui to have two (or three if US is checked) inputs to query the weather
  data. see coordinates by location name here:
https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api - DONE
- credit openweathermap data, add their license. - DONE
- buy license for the data protection law stuff and add these pages to my self
  hosted instance. (I guess don't add the data protection stuff to this repo,
since it is customized to me and the server I host it on). - DONE!.
- config the nuxt pwa module to display an icon and hide the task bar when the
  app was "downloaded" - DONE
- add possibility to use own api key - DONE
- write readme
- wait for adaption of imprint and gdpr stuff to english is done, then include
  it and release repo.



MAYBE:
- Add capability to display the current weather box 1) for every day (whole
  week) and 2) for every hour (next 8 hours)
- STYLING:
    - possibly: find someone who wants to design the app so I can apply the design
    - otherwise: put some hours into styling the app. perhaps just use a
      finished component library that looks somewhat decent.
        - when styling write the app cleaner with some components.
- add cookies to cache searched result, and api keys on the client (I guess this
  requires cookie consent. So it should be a "somewhat bigger" task.)
- add matomo to check data while keeping users privacy(I guess this also
  requires cookie consent. Either use a publicly available tool or code own).
- add a settings page which will adapt the units from eu to us.
- add localizations for different languages (i18n plugin is already set up)
- rate limit api calls when the user is using the hosters api key (only if flag
  is enabled, don't rate limit the user if it is the hoster himself)
- include donations page with different cryptos (I have to do this one day
  anyway, so probably check for solutions or just code it for this project)
