TODOS:
- try merge requests workflow although I am working alone until first release.
  See how it will play out. --> Use feature branch workflock for all other
todos. - DONE
- add .env.example (did lose my .env since I switched workstation) - DONE
- adapt ui to have two (or three if US is checked) inputs to query the weather
  data. see coordinates by location name here:
https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api - DONE
- credit openweathermap data, add their license. - DONE
- buy license for the data protection law stuff and add these pages to my self
  hosted instance. (I guess don't add the data protection stuff to this repo,
since it is customized to me and the server I host it on). - DONE!.
- config the nuxt pwa module to display an icon and hide the task bar when the
  app was "downloaded"
- release repo



MAYBE:
- add matomo to check data while keeping users privacy.
- display hourly and weekly data
- add onclick and only display hourly or weekly at once.
- add translanslations (en only) and case for [loading, initial]
- add default metric to german stuff
- think about settings page (STATE=US (0/1), own api_KEY string, locale =
  en( maybe soon more),
- rate limit api calls
- add locale depending on settings
- how to cut/overflow hidden/ make only one row for location?
- use icons from openweathermap api
- create component for row?
- get decent icons XD?
- display weekly with 7x daily, maybe with onclick on data display the detail
  widget/box?
- include donations page with different cryptos! (this should be a different project to
  be fair)
