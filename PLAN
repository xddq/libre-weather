- add translations to all text (default to english) i18n!
- build box for hourly and weekly data (figma -> hourly data left and weekly
  data right. back button on right if one of them is open)
- rate limit calls


TODOS:
- display hourly and weekly data
- add onclick and only display hourly or weekly at once.
- add nuxt pwa module
- add translanslations (en only) and case for [loading, initial]
- add default metric to german stuff
- think about settings page (STATE=US (0/1), own api_KEY string, locale =
  en( maybe soon more),


decisions:
- use i18n in sfc components to possibly reuse components.


maybe:
- add locale depending on settings
- how to cut/overflow hidden/ make only one row for location?
- use icons from openweathermap api
- create component for row?
- get decent icons XD?


TODOS:
- download icons and use correct icon! :) - done
- display weekly with 7x daily?
- include donations page with different cryptos!
- credit openweathermap data ! license etc..!
