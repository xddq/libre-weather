MAYBE:
- add cookies to cache searched result, and api keys on the client (I guess this
  requires cookie consent. So it should be a "somewhat bigger" task.)
- store the last queried date in cookies and query the weather if date is > 30 /
  60min.
- STYLING:
    - possibly: find someone who wants to design the app so I can apply the design
    - otherwise: put some hours into styling the app. perhaps just use a
      finished component library that looks somewhat decent.
        - when styling write the app cleaner with some components.
- Add capability to display the current weather box 1) for every day (whole
  week) and 2) for every hour (next 8 hours)
- add matomo to check data while keeping users privacy(I guess this also
  requires cookie consent. Either use a publicly available tool or code own).
- create popup which asks to "download the app" based on the usage time (maybe
  once after some minutes, or after some days) can probably only do this after
having matomo
- add a settings page which will adapt the units from eu to us.
- add localizations for different languages (i18n plugin is already set up)
- rate limit api calls when the user is using the hosters api key (only if flag
  is enabled, don't rate limit the user if it is the hoster himself)
- include donations page with different cryptos (I have to do this one day
  anyway, so probably check for solutions or just code it for this project)
